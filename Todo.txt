- [X] I need to implement a jumping system and a proper system for gravity. As it is right now, it's very basic and not looking good.
-  I need to add a texture to each quad in the game, with a name to identify it
- Build the game from the ground up: spells, enemies, etc. 
- Replace all the texture names with proper sprites
- Create game states for enemies: idle, chasing, attacking if in X range, returning, dying, etc.
- Determine the logic between enemies game states transitions, etc.
