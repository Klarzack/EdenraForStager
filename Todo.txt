[DONE] I NEED TO CREATE BETTER ART FOR THE MENU AS IT'S IN A PRETTY BAD STATE

[DONE] IMPLEMENT FRUSTUM CULLING, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IN THE GAME BY FAR!!!!

IMPLEMENT QUAD TREE, THERE IS SO MUCH OVERHEAD TO LOOP THROUGH THE VECTOR TO RUN THE FRUSTUM CULLING THAT IT'S SIMPLY NOT WORTH IMPLEMENTING IT WITHOUT
A QUAD TREE. WITHOUT FC I GET 86FPS AT 2 MILLION SQUARES. WITH FC I GET 146 BECAUSE I KEEP LOOPING THOUGH THE VECTOR.
