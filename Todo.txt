Handling text input

I do not want to go by the general convention when handling text input and use a library. My text input consists of numbers only, from 0 to 9.
This means that all I need to do is find a way to render those based on user input in OpenGL.
This is my plan for doing it:

1. define a quad where text input will be active
2. if user clicks on the quad, the quad will become active.
3. if user types a number, a number will be drawn inside the quad (that means, we create another quad on the fly where the specific number will be applied as texture)
